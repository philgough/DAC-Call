		<i>Science of the Unseen</i> considers how representing and experiencing micro-processes animates new ways of perceiving macro-shifts within the world. How does envisioning micro-worlds such as cellular division in bodies or insect burrows in trees enable us to creatively interpret the larger dynamic flux of the world and the many species that inhabit it? How does technology mirror and magnify the art of nature and also produce urgent geological effects? How is the production of scientific knowledge both situated and global? 
	</p>
	<p class="justified">
		The art works in this exhibition propose new research directions and practical applications for examining unseen relations. This online exhibition seeks submissions that use artistic methods that articulate scientific creativity and critically examine what drives the discipline. Here, by expressing both inspiration and nodes of resistance in how science sees the world, artistic interpretation emphasizes the cultural and political dynamic within the power of the seen. <i>Science of the Unseen</i> asks, how does art express and empower the relationships between small and large, micro and macro, that would otherwise be invisible—either to the human eye or through the scientific lens?
	</p>
	<p class="justified">
		This online exhibition welcomes artistic interpretation and collaborations working from any scientific discipline, including but certainly not limited to: geology, particle physics, biology, and astronomy. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>Science of the Unseen</i> is an online exhibition coordinated by the ACM Siggraph Digital Arts Community. <br/>

		<h3>Criteria for Selection </h3>
	</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Aesthetic quality of the work.</li>
			<li>Novel use of digital techniques and visual mappings, artistic response and interpretation of the topic</li>
			<li>Creative interpretation of the topic</li>
			<li>Mathematical and computational phenomena, such as fractals and recursive algorithms are outside the scope of this exhibition, unless they are directly linked to the topic of reinterpreting <i>science of the unseen</i>.</li>
			<li>Use of public domain and fair use images are acceptable, but must be credited by the artists</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Submission Format</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
		Artists may submit works in any of 3 formats:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Static</b>
				<ul>
					<li>A coherent suite of up to 4 Any number of images may be submitted for exhibition., but no more than 2 exhibited for each submission.</li>
					<li>Images should be a minimum of 1280x720 pixels for online display, they do not need to be print quality.  Files larger than 3000px on the longest edge will be accepted, but may be scaled down for display online display.</li>
					<li>Images may include photographs of physical (e.g. sculptural) work.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Moving</b>
				<ul>
					<li>An artist may submit a video which can be hosted on Vimeo account run by ACM SIGGRAPH and then embedded in the gallery page.  Artists are strongly encouraged to ensure that they have reviewed Vimeo’s video compression guidelines at <a href="https://vimeo.com/help/compression">vimeo.com/help/compression</a>.</li>
					<li>Artists are strongly encouraged to submit work in HD format (either 1280x720 or 1920x1080).</li>
					<li>Videos should be approximately 5 minutes, but videos will be accepted between 1 and 10 minutes in length.</li>
					<li>Videos documenting interactive installation work can be submitted, but will be judged on the artistic merit of the video, not the artistic merit of the installation.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Interactive web-based works</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Interactive pieces are encouraged to be submitted, based around open-ended exploration, or short, guided interactions with time-based media.  For interactive works with time-based media, the user should not need to spend more than 5 minutes to interact with the time-based component of the work.The minimum amount of time to interact with any Interactive, time-based work should not exceed 5 minutes.</li>
					<li>They should run using JavaScript, and be easily displayed inside a &lt;div&gt; element on a page.</li>
					<li>No plugins should be required to display on a normal web browser.</li>
					<li>Suggested technologies include:
						<ul>
							<li>D3.js, Processing.js or other 2D visualisation frameworks</li>
							<li>WebGL/Three.js/X3DOM and other Web3D technologies, which do not require browser plugins.</li>
							<li>Works that run in the HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element, which do not require plugins.</li>
							<li>Artists are encouraged to avoid relying on server-side technology, but use client-side work.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Interactive pieces should also require no additional hardware, such as a LeapMotion or Oculus Rift.  This online exhibition aims at being accessible to anyone.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Selection of Works</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
		The works will be selected by a panel of international experts, which will be formed to bring together a diverse set of backgrounds in art, curation, science and art+science collaboration.
	</p>
	<p>
		The online gallery may also include curated works, which can be selected by the committee.  These will be leading examples in the field, and may include works from the committee members and jurors.
	</p>
	<p>
		Artists will be required to submit a short (approximately 100 word) synopsis of their work.  We encourage artists to include any links to published scientific papers, data repositories, and scientist profiles that are directly linked to the creation of the submitted work in addition to their synopsis.
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Membership</h3>
	</p>
	<p>
		Participants are encouraged to become part of the ACM SIGGRAPH Digital Arts Community, but it is not a requirement for submission.  Join at <a href="http://siggrapharts.ning.com/">siggrapharts.ning.com</a>
